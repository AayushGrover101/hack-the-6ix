"Oh you were just at the campus Tims? I was JUST there wow D:" has been an event most have felt, especially for those studying at sparse universities. Given the limited time that university students may have, these small moments mean the world to those that always feel too busy for a dinner night out. As such, we built an app that makes these unexpected moments impossible to miss, while also providing an exciting build-up feeling.

"boop" is an app for fun that makes these unintentional (or intentional!) meetups much more common. Users can add friends where if one is detected to be in close proximity, it begins to vibrate the phone! It starts off with slight, delayed buzzes, which slowly grows and speeds up as you get closer to your friend. If the user also wants extra help, we provide an integrated compass, alerts for wrong direction, and rough distance from target. 

All haptics and gyroscopic features were built using Expo, a react-native framework, with distance being calculated using latitude and longitude. We also used web sockets to implement real-time updates and MongoDB to store user location data.
